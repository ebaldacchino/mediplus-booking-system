# Mediplus Booking System

This project is a clone from the design of a medical booking app I found [here](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/mediplus-doctors-appointment-booking-app-ui-ux-case-study-5ecf06fd13ca) around the start of August. 

I've been working on a separate booking system of my own, and have been having trouble handling the UI and UX, so I decided to find a design online and build it for future reference.

This project is a serverless web App using:
    Next JS (Create Next App)
    Mongoose
    Serverless functions
    Cookie Based Authentication

The environment variables include:
    TOKEN_SECRET
    MONGO_URI
